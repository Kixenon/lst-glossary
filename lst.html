<p>
    A scenario where the next <a href="tetris.html#tspin-slot">T-Spin slot</a> is raised
    by {n} number of <a href="tetris.html#cell">minos</a> vertically, not counting the effects of any <a href="tetris.html#clear">line clears</a> that happen between consecutive T-Spins.
    The distance is counted by minos between T-piece centres, but not including the centres themselves.
